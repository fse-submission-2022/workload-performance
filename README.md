# On the Relation of Software Configurations and Workloads: An Empirical Study of Performance

## Interactive Dashboard
We provide an interactive dashboard using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that allows exploring in detail our analysis for each configuration option and workload. For the best experience, we provide a Docker file to run the dashboard locally.
### Build & Run Docker image
```bash
cd ./dashboard
sudo docker build -t streamlitapp:latest .
docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlitapp:latest
```
You can now explore the dashboard at [https://127.0.0.1:8501](https://127.0.0.1:8501).
